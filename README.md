# Sinatra Part 1

## Objectives

Introduce students to Sinatra and practice generating web content using a route written in Ruby.

## SWBATS

- SINATRA: Serve basic web pages from different routes on the same app
- SINATRA: Understand how Sinatra allows us to handle dynamic information and serve it on
request

## Introduction

**Sinatra is a Ruby Application that can respond to HTTP Requests**

- It's a program that's always on once started; it listens for web requests
- Start your Sinatra application by running `shotgun config.ru` in the terminal
- `config.ru` is a Ruby file that tells Sinatra how to run your application.

**NOTE:** You will be walking students through a sample Sinatra app. Starter code has been provided: [KWK Sinatra Starter](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/kwk-sinatra-starter)

**Students should open [KWK Sinatra Starter](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/kwk-sinatra-starter) in the Sandbox.**

**Everyone should type in shotgun and go to the IP address of your server in your browser.**

**Hit refresh a few times, notice it changes the content every time, that's because ruby is processing this request every time and can dynamically generate a response.**

Let's follow the flow of how this program started:

First, `config.ru` runs
https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/kwk-sinatra-starter/blob/master/config.ru

In `config.ru`, `environment.rb` is called when it is required
https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/kwk-sinatra-starter/blob/master/config/environment.rb

The `environment.rb` file gets all our code loaded into memory. We haven't
covered gems/bundler, but in short, they are super powers you can inherit, like
the entire Sinatra source code, in this case.

Once we have all that code loaded, we jump back to `config.ru`, because none of
that code is being run yet. Back in `config.ru`, _ApplicationController_ is run
on line 3:
https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/kwk-sinatra-starter/blob/master/config.ru#L3

https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/kwk-sinatra-starter/blob/master/app/controllers/application_controller.rb

The ApplicationController is going to be what creates different "pages" for our
application. On line 3 of `config.ru`, the word `run` on is Sinatra; it says,
'hey, use this class as the object that has all the logic for our web
application.' And with that... _our application starts._

### CFU

<insert CFU here: check student comprehension of the steps above + create flow chart / anchor chart>

### Building Routes to Content

Again, Sinatra, in essence, is a Ruby app that, when started, will start
listening for HTTP requests.  When a request is received, ApplicationController
is checked for a matching _route_.  In the starter code students have, when they
enter the IP they were given into the URL bar, their app _heard_ the request,
went to the ApplicationController and looked to see if the request matched
anything

### Cooking Up Some Content

Imagine you're the new chef of a five star restaurant, and orders are coming in!
You're still pretty new, but luckily, you've been given a book of instructions
on how to make each meal a customer can order.

Each order comes in on a small slip of paper and says something.. one order says
`spaghetti`, another says `veggie burrito`, and another says `sushi`.  You get
the requested order, go and look in your book, find the matching instructions,
cook the meal, arrange the food and send the plate out.

If I **get** `spaghetti`... find and follow the instructions for `spaghetti` and
send out a plate when done.
If I **get** `cheeseburger`... find and follow the instructions for `cheeseburger`
and send out a plate when done.

Sinatra routes work similarly... If Sinatra _gets_ a request for `something`, it
looks for instructions for that `something`, and if found, follows them,
returning whatever it has put together.

The `something` is the specific path requested within a site; everything on the
URL that immediately follows the base site URL:

```
www.new-chef-in-five-star-restaurant.com/spaghetti
www.new-chef-in-five-star-restaurant.com/sushi
www.new-chef-in-five-star-restaurant.com/
159.203.187.180:8080/spaghetti
localhost:3000/sushi
```

In this case, '/spaghetti', '/sushi', _and_ '/' are the specific paths within the site. If there isn't anything after the base URL, the path is equal to '/'.

## CFU

<insert CFU here (ideas: student turn & talk, create your own metaphor for Sinatra functionality, other?)>

## Writing the Recipe Instructions

Sinatra knows what to do, it's a good cook, we just need to give it the
instructions - if our application _gets_ `/sushi` or `/` or `/about_page` we
need to tell Sinatra to what to do in response:

```ruby
get '/' do
  "Hello World"
end
```

Huh... writing these instructions looks very much like the _Ruby methods_ we
just learned about! In the above example, if our app _gets_ a request for `/`,
it returns "Hello World".

We can make as many of these as we like.

```ruby
get '/spaghetti' do
  "Hello Spaghetti"
end

get '/sushi' do
  "Hello Sushi"
end
```

And if our Sinatra app _gets_ a request for any of these, it will match our
instructions and return the correct text!

<!--  [Hello World
Lab](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/kwk-l1-sinatra-hello-world-basics)
(would love to this to mirror the structure from MVC in the starter as we'll
never use app.rb in this course)  -->

## CFU

Write your own set of recipe instructions. Instructor circulates to ensure
student comprehension and one-on-one check-ins with scholars as necessary.

## Dynamic Responses

Okay, going back to the new chef metaphor.. you're doing great, following the
cooking instructions, but the owner has decided to expand the menu a bit.  They
want an _surprise_ special. If a customer orders the `special`, they will get a
different meal every time.

As the chef, when you get these orders, you look at your instruction book and it
says:

```
mix random things together on a plate.
```

...and so you do. One customer gets spaghetti car banana, another gets spicy
peanut butter, and another gets ice cream filet of shoe sole.  This is a dynamic
response.  You don't always get the same thing!

Okay, how does this relate to Sinatra? Well, we do something similar: we can
write instructions for what to do, but those instructions _may not be set in
stone_.  We could change them as we see fit.. change the response depending on
the time of day, or return the current time. We could make the response
_random_.

We just need to give the instructions, and Sinatra will follow them.  Writing a
route with a dynamic response in Sinatra looks like this:

```ruby
get '/random' do
  "#{rand(1..100)}" # Picks a number from 1 to 100
end

get '/current_date' do
  Time.now().strftime("%c") # Gets the current time and date, converts it to string format
end
```

## CFU

With a partner, figure out some commands that might be dynamic. Help students differentiate between dynamic v. static concepts.

## Returning HTML

So far, we've got Sinatra sending single lines of text in response to requests,
but what if we wanted a bunch of HTML, instead?

```ruby
get '/random' do
  "<h1>Hello!</h1><h2>The time is #{Time.now}</h2><p>#{rand(1..100)}></p>" # Picks a number from 1 to 100
end
```

That's not going to work. We've seen HTML, too. We wouldn't want a whole HTML
page listed out like this.. it would be impossible to read.

Instead of serving up strings, like we've done so far, Sinatra can serve up
_files_.

Back on our Sinatra starter code again:

In our ApplicationController:

https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/kwk-sinatra-starter/blob/master/app/controllers/application_controller.rb#L9

We've got a familiar looking `get` route here, but instead of returning a
string, we've got `erb :'index.html'`.

In a nearby folder, `app/views/`, we have a file called `index.html.erb`:

https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/kwk-sinatra-starter/blob/master/app/views/index.html.erb

This is how Sinatra serves up whole webpages. Using ERB files (embedded Ruby),
we can write HTML just as we were doing earlier this week, and have Sinatra serve
them at specific routes.

## ERB <%= %> and <% %>

In our starter app, on `index.html.erb`, there is something new that we haven't
seen yet.

There is _Ruby_ inside of our HTML! The `rand(1..100)` and
`Time.now().strftime("%c")` methods we saw earlier when talking about dynamic
responses... are _inside_ our HTML content.

We do this with ERB! Any time we want some dynamic content we can inject it into
our HTML simply by wrapping the Ruby in the following tags: `<%= %>`. These are
_special_ wrappers. When the file is read by Sinatra as it prepares to respond
to a request, these tags will be read and executed just like lines of Ruby code.

```html
<p>The time is now: <%= Time.now() %></p>
```

This example will always return the exact time when the HTML page was read by
Sinatra.

There are two types of wrappers we need to use.  The one we've seen is `<%= %>`.
This executes Ruby code, and then _prints_ it as HTML. This is how we get the
dynamic examples we've seen.

There is a second one: `<% %>`. This wrapper looks similar, but is missing the `=`
symbol.  Code written in this wrapper will execute, _but will not print_.

This may not seem very helpful at first, but what it does is allows us to run
multiple lines of Ruby inside our HTML and only display what _we_ choose to
display.  Doing this gives us the ability to put all kinds of code in our HTML
pages!

One great example: conditional statements.

```html
<% if Time.now().day === 2 %>
  <p>It's Tuesday My Friends!</p>
<% else %>
  <p>It's not Tuesday :(</p>
<% end %>
```

If the above code was placed within a `index.html.erb` in our starter code,
it would display 'It's Tuesday My Friends!' _only_ on Tuesdays.

Remember, `<%= %>` will print whatever is return from the Ruby inside, `<% %>`
will just execute the Ruby.

**Students should try to add in ERB tags to `index.html.erb` and try different things. A good challenge: create a conditional in ERB that returns heads or tails based on a random number.**

### Variables

Not only can you write Ruby inside HTML.. you can also _pass_ Ruby variables into
the HTML files.. _from ApplicationController_.

```ruby
get `/sushi` do
  @sushi = "spicy tuna rolls"
  erb :'index.html'
end
```

```html
<p> I really love <%= @sushi %></p>
```

Added to `index.html.erb`, the above line will print "I really love spicy tuna rolls"! Make sure every variable starts with `@`.  This is necessary for ERB to execute correctly.

**Students should try creating variables in the ApplicationController**

# That's Sinatra basics!

Phew! That was a lot to process, but with a little practice, you can use what
you're learning today to build _all kinds_ of dynamic web applications!
